# Link

A simple Tent post type for sharing/referencing a URL, typically to a web page.

Posts of other types may reference `link` posts for use in a particular context.

For example, a [status](https://tent.io/docs/post-types#status) post could reference a `link` for sharing in a conversation (as that is the nature of `status` posts). This would be an alternative to adding the URL inline in the `text` field of the `status` post. It _could_ result in a representation similar to Twitter's cards when rendered. "Cleaner" methinks.

Another example is a `share` post having only a `comment` field, referencing the `link` post that has the URL. A `bookmark` post might reference a `link` and add more metadata in its fields.

Two posts would have to be created in these examples, first the `link` and then the "parent" post. Tent servers will return any referenced posts as part of the return data for a queried post.

#### Schema

| Property | Required | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `url` | Required | String | The URL that is shared. |

#### Example

```json
{
  "content": {
    "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dark-social-we-have-the-whole-history-of-the-web-wrong/263523/",
  }
}
```

#### Thoughts

What would be best â€“ a minimal, generic `link` post ref'd by other posts, such as `bookmark`, `share`, `status`, `whatever`? Or specific post types for each use case, with a `url` field?

- What's the performance and storage cost of using refs a lot?
- Would a side effect of a generic `link` type be that if you subscribe to someone's `link` posts, you'd get anything from `bookmark` posts to `share` posts to _whatever_ is referencing a `link`, without the context?
- (brainstorming) Could web links even be part of the [post schema](https://tent.io/docs/posts#post-schema), on the same level as refs, mentions and attachments?
